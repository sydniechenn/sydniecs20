        <p>This is a night time view of my hometown, Taipei, Taiwan. <br /> 
        After moving to Boston for college, I've started really <br/> appreciating  the beauty and uniqueness of my hometown. Now, I <br/> can proudly say that it's my favoirte place in the world! </p>

        <h3>What no one expects about me:</h3>
        <p>This fact is a little bit gross, but I have 4 extra teeth in <br/> my mouth behind my wisdom teeth. I also have a really small <br/> mouth, so in total, I'll need to remove 10 teeth from my mouth <br/> to fit everything in nicely (I've removed 6 so far).</p>
